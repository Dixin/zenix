## 🚀 Why Zenith?

The market is flooded with standard, safe, centered layouts. Zenith breaks the mold. We built Zenith with aggressive architectural decisions to ensure your product looks **premium, hand-crafted, and technically sophisticated.**

*   **⚡️ Blazing Fast:** Built on Astro's islands architecture. Ships zero JavaScript by default.
*   **💅 "Anti-Generic" Design:** Features a complex asymmetrical "Bento Box" grid, subtle scroll-reveal animations, and bespoke typography (Space Grotesk + Inter).
*   **🌑 True Dark Mode:** Not just inverted colors. A dedicated OLED-optimized dark theme engine built natively with Tailwind `dark:` variants.
*   **🧠 SPA-like Routing:** Utilizes Astro's native `<ViewTransitions />` for instant, seamless page navigation.
*   **📝 Powerful Content Engine:** Write in MDX. Comes with a sticky, auto-updating Table of Contents and custom UI components (like `<Callout>`) out of the box.

All content lives in the `src/content/` directory. You can write using standard Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`).
